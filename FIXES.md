# Fixes list

Every known problem, who is fixing it, and where it stands. This is the team's single to-do list.

## How this file works

- **Adding a problem (Gawyn or any human):** add one line under **New**. A sentence is enough, with no owner or ID needed. Commit it straight to `main` with no PR: run `git pull --rebase` first, then commit only this file.
- **Lead (Gawyn's Claude):** watches this file. It gives each new line an ID and an owner, moves it to **Open**, and tells the owner on the board. An item moves to **Done** only after the lead has checked it on `main`.
- **Every agent:**
  - Read this file at the start of every task and after every `git pull`.
  - Work on items with your name, top to bottom (`high` before `low`).
  - Put the ID in your branch and PR title, e.g. `28-fix-3-plain-cards` and "FIX-3: …".
  - Post on the board when you start and when you merge, as usual.
  - Don't edit this file: tell the lead on the board, and the lead updates it.

## Temporary handoffs

- **Yousuf's Claude is out of usage** (Yousuf, 08:41). Until it's back:
  - Its files go to Yousuf's Gemini: `frontend/` shell, `frontend/app/ui/`, `frontend/api/client.ts`, `vite.config.ts`, `frontend/app/workspace.tsx`, `pages/portfolio/`, `pages/network/`, `pages/compare/`, `frontend/app/scenario.tsx`.
  - Its frontend PR reviews go to Yousuf's Gemini. The lead's browser check stands in for the review on #186 and #193.
  - It has no open items: its FIX-28 part is done (#212).
- **Bekarys's Claude is out of usage** (since 07:30; Bekarys's Gemini, 08:43). Bekarys's Gemini takes its open items, in this order:
  1. Rebase and merge PR #193 (FIX-11 job research, lead-approved).
  2. PR #186 (FIX-17 AI cards): apply Yousuf's Claude's two review fixes ("AI suggested N; we kept M" wording; a `<div>`, not a `<p>`, around the Spinner), rebase, merge.
  3. FIX-22 job side in `hoc/jobs.py`: a separate 8-worker research pool; start deadlines of light 50 s and thorough 95 s.
  - Its backend files (`service.py`, `api/`, `jobs.py`, `tests/api/`) go to Bekarys's Gemini until it's back.

## Open

### FIX-34 · high · An unsupported "sole source" flag can make an ordinary supplier critical (issue #216, B)
`extractor.verify_and_build_edges` copies the model's raw `sole_source=True`. `verify_quote` checks only the quote and name, so "We buy components from ZZ alongside several other vendors" with `sole_source=True` passes with no flags and becomes 0.95 / critical.
- Fix: ground `sole_source`, and any revenue-share qualifier, in the target-specific quote (sole/single/only source wording near the target) before it can raise importance. If it's unsupported, keep the ordinary supplier link, drop the flag, and add a rules flag. Add tests from the issue.
- **Owner:** Kendrick's Gemini (`hoc/ai/extractor.py`, `hoc/ai/interpretation.py`) · **Status:** assigned

### FIX-9 · medium · Final QA of both views
- Fix: once everything above merges, audit the full and simple views end to end; send problems to their owners.
- Also test with no AI key or SEC contact: page 4 must say "The AI check couldn't run on this computer" (FIX-4 was checked in code only).
- **Owner:** Bekarys's Gemini · **Status:** interim QA passed on everything merged through #183, including a live no-key/no-contact test of page 4; final pass after FIX-1 and FIX-17.

## Done (checked on `main` by the lead)

- FIX-30 simplified walkthrough of the real app: Simple mode uses the same sidebar and pages with plain-English versions and dismissible tips, and the five-step guide stays reachable. The lead checked it in the browser. Yousuf told Codex to merge it, with the default `BEGINNER_START_PAGE = "#/portfolio"` (the walkthrough). Gawyn can switch the default to `#/guide` in `frontend/app/experience.tsx:18` — #221 (audit split into FIX-31, FIX-33, FIX-34)
- FIX-33 importance: customer shares grounded to the target (live: Applied Materials' customer rated high from its own 19%, not the other's 15%); headquarters low 0.30; reverse customer links capped. On the sample only `critical.CIK:0000804328` (1.43%) drops out; `critical.ALIAS:TSMC` stays 12.39%, so the docs are unchanged — #220
- FIX-35 main is green again (561 passed) — #218
- FIX-31 importance badges show the tier only (no "Critical 90%"); the graph legend says "Line thickness = how much of your money is in that company" — #219
- FIX-32 one-liners read "Checked: Nvidia's partnership with OpenAI — still unclear" and "Checked: Apple's reliance on Japan — confirmed"; FIX-11 casts removed — #219
- FIX-17 change ideas: Argon proposes and Python verifies. Screen 5 and Try a change show "AI suggested 5 ideas; we kept 3" with reasons, "AI idea, checked with your numbers" cards, and Try this (lead: the QQQ→VTV swap loads as QQQ 1 sh + VTV 9 sh; Technology 51.1% → 41.7% after whole-share rounding, card says 41.8%). Rules fallback when there's no key — #177–#181, #185, #186, #192, #194, #197, #199, #201, #207, #210
- FIX-22 research time budgets (lead, live): light 62 s (was 131), 0 'not finished' (was 4); thorough 193 s, 1 'not finished' (was 15), 40/45 findings use search_filings — #206, #217
- FIX-11 research findings show while the scan runs (lead, live: thorough job.research grew 3 → 7 → 13 → … → 41 → 45) — #170, #193
- FIX-29 beginner-friendly text: AI cards on the Dependencies page show one plain sentence with a Full detail toggle (lead: 514 → 1,335 chars when opened); section intros are one sentence; guide step 4 shows one line per finding ("Checked: Apple Inc. single-source reliance on Japan — confirmed") with Details. Kendrick's Gemini may polish wording such as "Nvidia -> OpenAI" — #214
- FIX-28 "What's here & why" on every page; copy has no stale numbers; Risk thresholds 35/100 days; Light vs Go deeper described correctly — #207, #212, #213, #214
- Thorough held-out eval after FIX-22's research side: 35/35 findings with 3 tool calls and `search_filings`, 0 budget stops; thorough keeps every light edge; 0 links changed, so precision and recall are unchanged (88.4% / 96.1% / 57.4%). Reproduced offline by the lead — #211
- FIX-26 AI idea text: no rewriting. Unclear AI sentences are dropped and the card shows Python's reason. Live: VTV and SCHD ideas kept with rationale None and correct reasons; XLV keeps its clean sentence — #207, #210
- FIX-27 clicking a graph edge opens the section and its evidence drawer; Show less then folds it and it stays folded with the edge still selected (lead, browser) — #205
- FIX-23 the four Dependencies sections fold to a 280 px faded preview with Show all / Show less, and Countries is stacked. Lead check: each section 280 px when folded, 1.6k–12k px open; the page is 19,196 → 4,690 px at 1280×800 (PR) — #203
- FIX-25 AI swaps into XLV and VTV accepted under a worst-case industry check (live: XLK→XLV Technology 51.1% → 41.2%; QQQ→VTV → 41.8%; all 3 AI ideas match compare) — #201
- FIX-24 the idea proposer reaches Argon (the invalid timeout argument is gone; timeouts classified by type) — #199
- FIX-21 docs: swap 12.39% → 6.30% (−6.10 pts), XLU 9.92%, slide 3 companies Nvidia/Broadcom/AMD/Intel, and the honest held-out agent result (+0.0 pp, no accuracy claims) — #195, #198
- FIX-8 before/after eval on the 10 held-out 10-Ks (light agents): precision 88.4% blind / 96.1% pooled and core recall 57.4%, all unchanged (+0.0 pp); 18 findings, 0 links added or removed; agentic check PASS (18/18 make 2+ tool calls, 0 circular). Reproduced offline by the lead — #196
- FIX-1, FIX-2, FIX-14 real research loop. Light: 17/23 findings make 2+ tool calls (was 3/25). Thorough: 27/45 use `search_filings` (was 0). Thorough keeps every light edge. 0 duplicate or group customer links — #189
- FIX-19 the bar resets only when a reused job starts again; a running bar at 100% stays at 100% — #187, #191
- FIX-20 compare measures both sides on the same companies (+20% XLU: 9.92%, exact dilution; swap: 12.39% → 6.30%) — #183
- FIX-7 README and DEMO cover v3.1 (shares default, simple view, Try a change, change ideas "coming") with verified numbers — #132. The FIX-8 numbers follow in a small PR from Gawyn's Gemini.
- FIX-18 progress bar never goes down: the total is set up front and only lowered (live: 106 → 100 → 65; 0% → 15% → 98% → 100%), and the pages never show a lower % — #172, #174
- FIX-16 screen 2 names the most overlapping pair (QQQ and XLK, 50.11%) — #174
- FIX-15 simple screen 1 is shares only, with % as plain text; the full view keeps the switch — #175
- FIX-10 plain titles match their text (live: "Heavy reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing") — #173
- FIX-6 pitch deck leads with the held-out eval (88.4% / 96.1% precision, 57.4% recall, 1 of 79), 40% verified coverage — #167
- FIX-12 all links cite a real 10-K Item (Microsoft, Alphabet sections fixed; 132/132 quotes exact) — #169
- FIX-13 PR #25 closed by Bekarys (branch kept)
- FIX-3 short AI cards on simple pages 4–5, "Read more", a splitter that keeps "Co., Ltd." whole; FIX-4 "couldn't run on this computer" (#151; live-tested by QA with no key and no contact); FIX-5 page 4 progress bar and "Go deeper" that updates in place — #166
- Try a change: starts from your portfolio, updates on its own, 4 rows — #156, #163
- Dependencies page progress bar and a single "Go deeper" — #160, #161
- Research agents, first version (follow-ups are FIX-1 and FIX-2) — #162
- Job progress and research depth — #157
- Plain AI summaries from the orchestrator — #159
- Shares by default, sample worth about $10,000, no duplicate button, no "#" ranks — #158
- Heavy industry overlap counts against diversification — #154
- Kendrick's Claude's work reassigned — #164
